# Wall

This is a project made with the help of [buildspace](https://buildspace.so) to learn Solana web3 development using Rust/Anchor/React.

It's basically a wall of gifs. You can post a gif by submitting it's [Giphy](https://giphy.com) direct URL. Everyone will be able to see it.

The rust program is deployed in [Solana Devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/address/Ehpw3rFuzgW6w9uwyxZMtwCb9q8xvXyhcj8WuzZh6tz1?cluster=devnet). To use the app, you have to switch your phantom wallet's network to the Devnet by going to settings > network and selecting Devnet. You can get Devnet SOL through [Sol Faucet](https://solfaucet.com/).
